		<h2>FAQ:</h2>
		<b>How often is the data on this website updated?</b><br/>
		Data is refreshed on a best effort basis, depending on whether and when our data sources make their data available<p/>
		<b>Why is the ticker I'm searching for not here?</b><br/>
		We currently only list tickers provided by <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/" target="_blank">Alphavantage</a><p/>
		Also, Lyquat deliberately excludes tickers described as "blank checks", "warrants", "acquisition"/"acquisition corp"/"debentures", <br/>and other similar instruments, that it does not deem relevant to its users<p/>	
		<b>What does "price" mean?</b><br/>
		We refer to the "adjusted close" (as opposed to "close") fields from our data sources. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusted_closing_price.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,The%20adjusted%20closing%20price%20amends%20a%20stock's%20closing%20price%20to,price%20before%20the%20market%20closes." target="_blank"><br/>Further info here</a></p>
